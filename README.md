# So here are my pixar movie rankings
1. Ratatouille
    * *A fantastically unconventional idea combinded with perfectly timed jokes!*
1. Incredibles
    * *The whole family dynamic is raw and real, something you rarly get from the typical super hero fare.*
1. Monsters Inc.
    * *Billy Crystal and John Goodman have a chemistry that rivals Amedeo Avogadro. Amedeo Avogadro as in Avogadro's number.*
1. Toy Story
    * *Nostalgia out the wazoo, need I say more?*
1. Up
    * *The first fifteen minutes get me every- dang-time.*
